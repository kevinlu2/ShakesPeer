            <h2>Kevin's Solutions</h2>
            <p>IThis task is testing the concepts of Ratios. The task is very easy to understand and follow so I think it would be a good task to introduce the concept. The use of the reality principle, fruit juices, allows the students to relate it to a real life scenario where they can reproduce the fruit juices. As the task is fairly simple, it is testing the basic concepts of ratios thus why I believe it is a good introduction task to the concepts.
            </p>
            <p>The task is a fairly lengthy word problem to which it is testing the basics of the concept. The task requires the students to write a diary response rather the typical mathematic answers. Such questions like this is more effective when completed in a team. Thus I believe this task is more suitable for MATHS102 or High School as they require the students to work in groups. The task itself is effective but kind of boring. The task is about mixing juice which isn’t a motivating or interesting. From a student’s perspective it can be seen as an interesting and useful task as they may have never encountered ratios before. I found the task confusing at first because I did not know what concept it was testing but once I knew which concept it was testing it became quite straightforward. I feel that other students who attempt the task may also be confused at first. This tasks fits well under the Higher Level Demands (Procedure with Connections) as it allows more than one procedure that have close connections to the conceptual ideas. Also it can only be solve by engaging with the conceptual ideas thus cannot be solved mindlessly. The criteria’s this task meets to make it an effective MEA task, are the reality principle, the model construction principle, the construct documentation principle and the effective prototype. I believe the task does not meet the criteria self-assessment principle, as the task does not indicate that students would be able to judge for themselves when their responses are needed to be improved. In this case, Neti’s method of making flapple juice is wrong however Neti’s method would generally be the most common mistake/answer students make. This causes students to rethink about the task to derive the correct method.  This method is able to act as a model to be used to answer similar tasks and thus meets the model construction principle. The marking scheme suggested that students draw diagrams to help visualise their method. For students that have not come across ratios and have completed this task, this can possibly be an effective prototype for some students as this task is unique, different from other tasks, and the name flapple is easy to remember, so thus many students may refer back to this task when undergoing ratio tasks. I believe that this task is a effective MEA task.
