He wrote play and poems like Titus Andronicus , The Taming of the Shrew and an early version of Hamlet. The playhouse that these productions there being watched in was built and owned by the father of the actor Richard Burbage up to 1597 then the expiry of the lease forced them out and they had the find a new playhouse. They eventually had to build a another playhouse on the south bank of the river. Witch is now famous and called the Globe with the massive expense that this needed the father of Burbage decided that they needed people to help finance this operation. So he got partners to help with the cost one of the partners was William Shakespeare and even Richard Bubage was given a place in this fathers business. This was good for Shakespeare because he now had some funding so he could concentrate on writing.
